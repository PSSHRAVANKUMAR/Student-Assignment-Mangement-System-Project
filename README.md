The primary objective of the Student Assignment Management System (SAMS) is to create a centralized and user-friendly platform that facilitates seamless assignment creation, submission, evaluation, and feedback in educational institutions. The system aims to improve overall efficiency by automating processes, reducing administrative burden, and providing valuable insights into student performance. With a focus on user convenience and academic effectiveness, SAMS strives to enhance the assignment management experience for both students and educators while promoting a transparent and organized approach to academic assessments.
